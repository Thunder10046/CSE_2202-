For task2.txt 

"// ofstream out("task2.txt"); //using constractor to open a file which was previously saved 

    // int rand_n; 
    
    // for (int i = 0; i < 10001; i++)
    // {
    //     rand_n = rand()%10001 + 1;      // this allows to generate eandom numbers which range from 1 to 10000. 
    //     out<<rand_n<<" ";        //writing the random numbers in the file 
    // }

    // out.close(); // closing the file, unless it would run in the background" 

    is commented because once you have created random numbers, unless you stop this portion of this code to execute, then after 2nd time on compiling, it would create random numbers once more and so on.
